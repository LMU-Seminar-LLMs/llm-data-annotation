# Lessons Learned

- **text-ada-001 Annotation**: Text-ada-001 was not optimal in annotating sentiments, producing noisy results even when set to output a single number per sentiment.
- **Model Cost**: Davinci is pricier than GPT-3.5 and is expected to be deprecated soon. GPT-3.5 is recommended as a baseline annotater model due to its cost-effectiveness.
